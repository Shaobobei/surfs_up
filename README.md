## Summary:
Hawaii is a tropical paradise!! Its location near the equator makes it very warm all year round. According to https://www.hawaii-guide.com/hawaii-weather it's usually about 76-85°F (24-29°C) and the nights are typically 12-18°F (7-8°C) cooler. And based on our research we can confirm that there is not much different in temperatures for June and December, Both Avg in the 70s, maxs in the 80s, and the lowest temp is in the 60s. Some would argue that is the most comfortable temperature (perfect for some ice cream). And being in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Hawaii has some of the best waves on the planet, that’s where W. Avy’s surf and ice cream shop will come in handy for the tourist; Surfing equipment to catch the waves and then ice cream for when they want to take a break and enjoy the views.
